        Acne is a chronic skin condition that arises when the pores of the skin become clogged with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria. It manifests as pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, or cysts, and most commonly appears on the face, back, and shoulders.
        
        Causes include hormonal imbalances, stress, poor diet, improper skin hygiene, and excessive use of oily or comedogenic products.
        
        ✅ Precautions: Maintain a regular skincare routine with non-comedogenic products, avoid touching the face frequently, cleanse your face twice daily, and use sunscreen.
        
        💊 Treatment: Over-the-counter products with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, prescribed topical or oral antibiotics, retinoids, hormone therapy, and in severe cases, isotretinoin.
